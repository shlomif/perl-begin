* Bad elements page:
    - Restore the navigation menu functionality.
    - Packaging as a CPAN distribution.
    - Parsing XML/HTML/JSON/CSV/etc. using regular expressions.
    - Generating Invalid markup (HTML, etc.)
    - flushing using $| = 1; instead of STDOUT->autoflush(1).
    - Generally - don't use punctuation variables.
    - change @list_of_names to @names_of_presidents in the example
        - Thanks GlitchMr
    - Conditional/temporary "use".
        - use is compile-time and will always be done.
        - use "require" or (less-prefarably) string-eval instead.
    - Unrelated packages (e.g: OtherModule) inside MyModule.
        - Preferably every package should be inside one module (except for
        private ones).
    - Non-explicit imports.
        - hard to track where identifiers come from.
    - Using my $i = 0 ; $array[$i++] = $value_to_append instead of
    perldoc -f push.

* Add a page about file/directory-handling :
    - Will share a lot of content with the Sys Admin page.
    - Refer to perldoc -f open and perldoc perlopentut.
    - Other CPAN modules.
        - File::Spec
        - File::Basename
        - File::Find
            - File::Find::Object
        - IO::All
        - File::Slurp
    - TODO: inotify/etc.
    - TODO: Add cookbook:
        - reading files.
        - copying files.
        - appending selected portion from a file to another file.
        - prepending to files.
        - overwriting lines in files.
        - deleting a directory tree.
        - writing to a file.
        - show all with IO::All and without it.

* Add a page about training providers:
    - http://pti.co.il/ - Perl Training Israel.
    - http://perltraining.com.au/ - Perl Training Australia.
    - http://perltraining.org/

* Perhaps a page about working with network protocols in general.

* Add more information about:
    - URI parsing.
    - Filenames and paths parsing.

* Books:
    - http://oreilly.com/catalog/0636920018476/ - Perl Pocket Reference.
        - All covering perl-5.14.x.
    - Peteris Krumins' Perl One-Liners Explained Book
        - TBD: which pages would be the best for it.

* Tutorials:
    - http://qntm.org/files/perl/perl.html
        - “Learn Perl in about 2 hours 30 minutes”
            - Upsides:
                - Short.
                - To the point.
                - Informative.
            - Downsides
                - Does not mention/cover CPAN.
                - Does not Moose/Mouse/Moo/etc..

* Fix the look of src/tutorials/hyperpolyglot/sheet1.html.wml
    - Add src/tutorials/hyperpolyglot/sheet2.html.wml

Long Term:
----------

* Maybe a page on «What's next "after" perl?».

* Pick up a better gvim colour scheme for the example code in the
perl-for-newbies lecture.

* Syntax-highlight the examples in the other code excerpts in the site
(especially the src/tutorials/bad-elements/ ).

* Add some screenshots to the /uses/games page.

* XML Page:
    - mention XML::Twig, XML::Easy .
