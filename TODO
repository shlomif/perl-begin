* Add some screenshots to the /uses/games page.

* Pick up a better gvim colour scheme for the example code in the
perl-for-newbies lecture.

* Syntax-highlight the examples in the other code excerpts in the site
(especially the src/tutorials/bad-elements/ ).

* Add http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Main_Page .

* Further work on src/uses/chat-scripting/index.html.wml .
    - Maybe trim the introduction.
        - remove the what is IRC? stuff almost completely and just say
        "Perl has good support".
            - we can assume people will know what it is, and if not
            there's the link.
    - Add Jabber/XMPP.
    - Add the other frameworks:
        - <perlbot> rindolf: Don't parse IRC with regex! See
          POE::Component::IRC, Bot::BasicBot. Avoid Net::IRC. See also
          http://poe.perl.org/ or Net::Async::IRC or AnyEvent::IRC .  
        - Not sure it's a good idea.

* Maybe a page on «What's next "after" perl?».

Long Term:
