    - Using one variable for two different things
        - assignment to a different value in the middle of the subroutine.
    - grep !/\A\./ for getting rid of "." and ".." in readdir().

* perl-begin FAQ:
    - references.
        - What's the difference between an array reference and an array?
        - Same for hash.
        - "I've tried doing $my_array_ref[3] but it didn't work."

* Add a page about training providers:
    - http://pti.co.il/ - Perl Training Israel.
    - http://perltraining.com.au/ - Perl Training Australia.
    - http://perltraining.org/

* Perhaps a page about working with network protocols in general.

* Add a tutorial on how to create CPAN distributions.
    - an up-to-date one is really needed.

* Add some screenshots to the /uses/games page.

* Add more information about:
    - URI parsing.
    - Filenames and paths parsing.

* Pick up a better gvim colour scheme for the example code in the
perl-for-newbies lecture.

* Syntax-highlight the examples in the other code excerpts in the site
(especially the src/tutorials/bad-elements/ ).

* Add http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Main_Page .

* Further work on src/uses/chat-scripting/index.html.wml .
    - Maybe trim the introduction.
        - remove the what is IRC? stuff almost completely and just say
        "Perl has good support".
            - we can assume people will know what it is, and if not
            there's the link.
    - Add Jabber/XMPP.
    - Add the other frameworks:
        - <perlbot> rindolf: Don't parse IRC with regex! See
          POE::Component::IRC, Bot::BasicBot. Avoid Net::IRC. See also
          http://poe.perl.org/ or Net::Async::IRC or AnyEvent::IRC .  
        - Not sure it's a good idea.

* Maybe a page on «What's next "after" perl?».

* Page about Perl Humour.
    - http://perl.net.au/wiki/Perl_Humour .

* Books:
    - http://oreilly.com/catalog/0636920018476/ - Perl Pocket Reference.
    - http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596004927/ - Programming Perl, 4th ed.
    - http://oreilly.com/catalog/0636920018452/ - Learning Perl, 6th ed.
        - All covering perl-5.14.x.
    - Peteris Krumins' Perl One-Liners Explained Book
        - TBD: which pages would be the best for it.

Long Term:
