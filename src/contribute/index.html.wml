<latemp_subject "Contribute to the Perl Beginners' Site" />

<p>
We feel that the Perl Beginners' Site should be a community site
instead of a centralized "Cathedral"-like site. Thus, the entire source
code is available online and contributions from outsiders are welcome.
There is a <a href="list/">list of contributors</a>, so make sure
your name appears there as soon as possible.
</p>

<p>
Here are some ways in which you can contribute to the site:
</p>

<h2 id="publicise">Publicise the Site</h2>

<p>
You can publicise the Perl Beginners Site or individual pages thereof by
posting or upvoting it in social-bookmarking sites, social networking sites,
recommending it to your friends online and offline, or linking to it from your
web-site or blog. You can use the "Add-to-any" button at the bottom of the
pages to post it on various sites.
</p>

<h2 id="wiki">Contribute to the Wiki</h2>

<p>
<a href="<wiki_link />">The Wiki</a> is a portion of the site that can
be edited by anyone at any time. Feel free to add your own material there.
</p>

<h2 id="mailing-list">Join the Mailing List</h2>

<p>
By joining <a href="<mailing_list_link />">the mailing list</a>, you will
receive questions by E-mail, which you can answer. (or alternatively be able
to ask your own)
</p>

<h2 id="web-forum">Visit the Help Web Forum</h2>

<p>
The <a href="<web_forum_link />">Help Web Forum</a> is meant to help people
with their Perl problems. You can visit it if you have questions or would like
to help people with their problems.
</p>

<h2 id="core-site">Contribute to the Core Site</h2>

<p>
You can send patches or corrections to the HTML pages of the site. It is
preferable to send corrections to the <a href="$(ROOT)/source/">site's
