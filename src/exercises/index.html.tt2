In order to learn Perl well (or any other language), one eventually needs
to write actual code with it. This page contains links to programming exercises
and challenges that can be solved using Perl.

<p>
From the page:
"Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming
problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve".
One can learn a lot from solving these challenges. In case you're having a
difficulty, then you can find solutions to some of these problems here:
</p>

<ol>

<li>
<p>
<a href="https://github.com/shlomif/project-euler-first-100-problems">Shlomi Fish's
Solutions to Project Euler</a> - mostly in Perl.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<a href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Euler_problems">Solutions
to the Euler Problems in the Haskell programming language</a> - on the Haskell
Wiki.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
A web search for a "euler" and a particular question number may also provide
some insights.
</p>
</li>

</ol>

<p>
But remember to always try to solve the challenges on your own first.
