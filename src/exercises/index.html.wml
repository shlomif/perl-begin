<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

<p>
In order to learn Perl well (or any other language), one eventually needs
to write actual code with it. This page contains links to programming exercises
and challenges that can be solved using Perl.
</p>

<h2 id="the_list">The List</h2>

<h3 id="learning-perl"><a href="$(ROOT)/books/#learning-perl">Learning
Perl</a></h3>

<p>
The book "Learning Perl" by Randal Schwartz et al contains many exercises
for beginning Perl programmers.
</p>

<h3 id="beginning-perl"><a href="$(ROOT)/books/#beginning-perl">Beginning
Perl</a></h3>

<p>
The book "Beginning Perl" by Simon Cozens and later on James Lee also contains
some exercises. The first edition of the book is available online.
</p>

<h3 id="project-euler"><a href="http://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler</a></h3>

<p>
From the page:
"Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming
problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve".
One can learn a lot from solving these challenges. In case you're having a
difficulty, then you can find solutions to some of these problems here:
</p>

<li>
<p>
<a href="http://bitbucket.org/shlomif/project-euler">Shlomi Fish's
Solutions to Project Euler</a> - mostly in Perl.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Euler_problems">Solutions
to the Euler Problems in the Haskell programming language</a> - on the Haskell
Wiki.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
A web search for a "euler" and a particular question number may also provide
some insights.
</p>
</li>

</ol>

<p>
But remember to always try to solve it on your own first.

Quiz of the Week</a></h3>

<p>
A now inactive series of challenges for solving using Perl that was started
by Mark Jason Dominus. One can go over the archives of the mailing lists
for some interesting problems to solve and their solutions.
