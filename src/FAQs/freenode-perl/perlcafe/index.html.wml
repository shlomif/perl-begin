<a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/#perlcafe">Freenode’s #perlcafe</a> is a <a
href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/symbiont">symbiont</a> channel to <a
href="http://perl-begin.org/FAQs/freenode-perl/">#perl</a>. It was
originally intended to host off-topic discussion and discussion about advanced
topics, so #perl will remain more focused on beginner problems. That did not
work quite as expected, but nevertheless #perlcafe took off, and now hosts a
lot of discussion that most people feel would rather not be hosted on #perl.
(Albeit sometimes the discussion there is more high-quality.)
</p>
<h2> Brief history </h2>
<p><a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/">rindolf</a> registered #perlcafe back
in 24 September 2004. The name was inspired by the Haskell-Cafe mailing list,
which is intended to move advanced and off-topic discussions off the main
mailing list. While having some initial flurry of activity, #perlcafe ended up
very quiet shortly afterwards.
</p>
<p>It all changed, one night when rindolf spent all night talking on #perl,
ended up getting de-voiced, and ended up /msg’ing some #perl people he
recognised and asking them to join #perlcafe. Afterwards, #perlcafe really took
off.
</p>
<h2> Note about the #perlcafe Attitude </h2>
<p>You can often hear a lot of racist statements, cursing, etc. on #perlcafe. But don’t worry - the people there know better than that, and are not really racist. "#perlcafe is not racist. It is offensive to everyone equally.". Especially, what is said on #perlcafe can be:
</p>
<ol><li> Anti-Semitic.
</li><li> Jewish-elitist.
</li><li> Anti-Israeli.
</li><li> Anti-Muslim.
</li><li> Sexist. (Against either or both genders).
</li><li> Anti-USArian.
</li><li> Anti-Canadian.
</li><li> Anti-French.
</li><li> Self-depracting.
</li></ol>
<p>So don’t take what is said there too seriously.
</p>
<h2> Café-speak </h2>
<p>There’s a variant of bad English used by some of the channel regulars to speak there, even though they know much better than that. It is somewhat different from <a href="http://icanhascheezburger.com/">the LOLCats variant</a> and predates it. Here’s a non-exhaustive guide on how to Café-speak:
</p>
<h3> "I R going", "he gaved me a present", "I likes cats", etc. </h3>
<p>Use the incorrect inflection of the verb.
</p>
<h3> "n u" </h3>
<p>Short for "No you."
</p>
<h3> "ghey", "hawt", "phag", "teh", "dum" </h3>
<p>Purposeful mispelling of words.
</p>
<h3> "Hell cl0ud" </h3>
<p>"Hell" is a one-letter shorter version of "Hello", but serves a similar meaning in the café.
</p>
<h3> /me cl0ud railbait dabreegster </h3>
<p>Sometimes people greet each other by using /me followed by a list of links to their friends which they can see. The friends are expected to reciprocate.
</p>
<h2> Common Topics </h2>
<h3> North American Politics </h3>
<p>It’s not uncommon to see the #perlcafe-ers paste some quotes from North American newspapers or web-sites regarding relatively obscure North American politics. We allow such things on #perlcafe, because we’d rather not see them on #perl.
</p>
<h3> Computer Games </h3>
<p>One common topic in #perlcafe is computer games. Normally cutting-edge "gamer" games, mostly for <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micrsoft_Windows">Microsoft’s Game Launcher</a> or for consoles. Some of the channel’s regulars are fond of playing such games, and like to discuss them.
</p>
<h3> Shania Twain </h3>
<p>Apparently, rindolf is the only computer geek who likes <a href="/web/20110220124213/http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shania_Twain">Shania Twain</a>’s songs, much to the dismay of the other channel regulars. (Some of whom are still fond of Ms. Twain’s looks.) As such he sometimes say <tt>* rindolf is listening to</tt> with a song of hers. This makes almost everyone else unhappy, and comment to rindolf that he should adopt a better musical taste.
</p>
<pre>   &lt;jkauffman&gt;	like if I went to your house and you started playing Shania Twain,
               I’d have to set fire to your computer
</pre>
<p>From #perlcafe
</p>
<pre>   &lt;tag&gt; rindolf: sort of like you were about shania twain, you know joking right?
   &lt;rindolf&gt; tag: but I actually bought a Shania Twain CD.
   * tag smacks rindolf
   &lt;tag&gt; wrong answer
   * rindolf is listening to Shania Twain - Up!
   &lt;rindolf&gt; I eventually found the B.E.P and Pink Floyd CDs in a different store.
   &lt;tag&gt; rindolf: dude you are so full of shit
   &lt;tag&gt; rindolf: you can listen to glitch and then blast mozart, but nobody
         likes pink floyd AND shania twain
   &lt;tag&gt; nobody likes *both* of those things.
</pre>
<p>From #perl (rindolf apparently belongs to the empty set).
</p>
<h2> The /topic </h2>
<p>The /topic is world-editable. We gave up on keeping up a meaningful /topic, and instead opt for some funny quotes. Feel free to set the topic to whatever you feel like. Here are some past selected topics:
