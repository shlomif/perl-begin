<ul>
<li>
The packages that can be used to compile and install kernel modules and
entire packages can assume that a GNU system is present. Namely that
GNU make, GNU install, gawk, gcc, etc. are present and at the appropriate
places. It cannot assume that Perl is installed though.
</li>
<li>
The CLAN code and the Module packager will be written in pure Perl 5, and
can depend on whatever publicly available CPAN modules that are known to
be portable and common enough. Eventually, a CPAN bundle will be prepared
to install everything including CLAN.
</li>
<li>
Generally, maintaining a simple CLAN module will be possible without too deep a
knowledge of Perl, but such knowledge may prove useful for advanced use.
</li>
<li>
I'll try to avoid using Autoconf and friends for the modules for as long as
I can. If we assume a GNU system, we can make a lot of simplifying assumptions.
</li>
<li>
Packages can be prepared along with a list of patches. They can be defined
inside the package or the package can be built while specifying them.
</li>
<li>
A kernel module package will contain an RPM Spec, Debianization file and other
native distribution packaging systems.
</li>
<li>
There should be planning but no over-engineering. I believe we can build
the functionality incrementally without re-writing the entire code from scratch
at a certain point.
</li>
</ul>
