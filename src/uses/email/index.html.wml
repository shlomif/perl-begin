<latemp_subject "E-mail Handling with Perl" />

<p>
Perl provides many facilities for handling E-mail (e.g: sending, receiving,
filtering, processing) available from the
<a href="$(ROOT)/topics/cpan/">CPAN (Comprehensive Perl Archive Network)</a>.
This is a summary of the recommended ones.
</p>

<h2 id="perl_email_project"><a href="http://emailproject.perl.org/">The Perl
Email Project</a></h2>

<p>
A project to create usable modules for handling E-mails in Perl. The page is
currently only a placeholder, but you can find the modules using
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?query=email&amp;mode=all">a CPAN
search for "Email"</a>. The Perl Email Project modules tend to be simple
and easy to use.
</p>

<h2 id="mail_box"><cpan_self_dist d="Mail-Box" /></h2>

<p>
An E-mail handling distribution for Perl 5 with a comprehensive API. Very large
and not very fast, and can be intimidating.
