<latemp_subject "SSH, Telnet and Other Remote Login and Commands Execution Protocols in Perl" />

<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

<p>
This page will describe how to use Perl to execute commands on remote
hosts using common Internet protocols such as
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telnet">Telnet</a> or
the more modern and more secure
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell">SSH (Secure Shell)</a>.
We are getting asked about these things a lot.
</p>

<h2 id="telnet">Telnet</h2>

<h3 id="Net-Telnet"><cpan_self_dist d="Net-Telnet" /></h3>

<p>
Net-Telnet allows one to run a Telnet session from within Perl and to interact
with it.
</p>

<h2 id="ssh">SSH (Secure Shell)</h2>

<p>
In SSH, the CPAN landscape is somewhat more hazy with many alternatives. Some
of the commonly mentioned ones are:
</p>

<ul>

<li>
<cpan_self_dist d="Net-SSH-Perl" />
</li>

<li>
<cpan_self_dist d="Net-OpenSSH" />
</li>

<li>
<cpan_self_dist d="Net-SSH2" />
</li>

<li>
<cpan_self_dist d="IPC-PerlSSH" /> and
<cpan_self_dist d="IPC-PerlSSH-Async" /> which is similar, but works with
<cpan_self_dist d="Net-Async" />.
</li>

</ul>

<p>
You should try some of them (or all of them) and see which one works the best
for you.
