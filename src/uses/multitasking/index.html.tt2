<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

<p>
In multitasking, the program performs several tasks at once. Multitasking
is closely related to networking where we have to handle several events
or serve several clients at once.
</p>

<h2 id="technologies">Technologies of Interest</h2>

<h3 id="ipc-run">[% cpan.self_dist( "d" => "IPC-Run", ) %]</h3>

<p>
A module that allows one to run background processes with piping, and ptys.
Works on UNIXes as well as Windows.
</p>

<h3 id="expect">[% cpan.self_dist( "d" => "Expect", ) %]</h3>

<p>
Allows one to control a terminal application interactively and wait for
events.
</p>

<h3 id="Parallel-ForkManager">[% cpan.self_dist( "d" => "Parallel-ForkManager", ) %]</h3>

<p>
A simple way to parallelise tasks. Also see
[% cpan.self_dist( "d" => "Parallel-ForkManager-Segmented", ) %].
</p>

<h3 id="event_frameworks">Event Driven Programming Frameworks</h3>

<p>
There are several frameworks available for event driven programming,
cooperative multitasking and writing network applications. You can find the
most important and most recommended ones on
<a href="[% base_path %]topics/cpan/">CPAN</a>. Here is a list of some of the
most recommended ones.
</p>

<h4 id="poe"><a href="http://poe.perl.org/">POE: Perl Object
Environment</a></h4>

<p>
POE was one of the first event-driven programming frameworks for Perl,
and gained some popularity in part due to lack of alternatives. Its style
is baroque and as such it may no longer be recommended.
</p>

<h4 id="IO-Async">[% cpan.self_dist( "d" => "IO-Async", ) %]</h4>

<p>
A popular framework for asynchronous events on CPAN.
</p>

<h4 id="discouraged_event_frameworks">Discouraged Event Frameworks</h4>

<h5 id="AnyEvent">[% cpan.self_dist( "d" => "AnyEvent", ) %]</h5>

<p>
<b>Note:</b> Using AnyEvent [% cpan_mod(m=>"Perl::Critic::Policy::Freenode::DiscouragedModules",body=>"is discouraged") %].
</p>

<p>
AnyEvent is a more modern events’ framework and allows one to make use of
extensions for other frameworks. It is also fast.

<h2 id="threads">Threads?</h2>

<p>
Many people are tempted to use threads with Perl and Internet forums are
constantly frequented for help with threads in Perl. However, the use of
threads in Perl is not recommended:
