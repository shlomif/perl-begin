<latemp_subject "Developing Games and Multimedia with Perl" />

<p>
What's the use of using a computer if you're not having fun? Many beginning
programmers, especially young ones, like to get their feet wet by writing
games, demos and other multimedia programs. And the good news is that they
can do it with Perl.

<p>
SDL Perl provides Perl bindings to the open-source and cross-platform
library
<a href="http://www.libsdl.org/">SDL - the Simple DirectMedia Layer</a> which
allows one to write games and other multimedia applications using it. SDL
has been utilised in several Perl and many other non-Perl games, both
open-source and commercial ones.

<p>
One can also prepare desktop games using standard GUI (Graphical User
Interface) toolkits. For this, see our <a href="$(ROOT)/uses/GUI/">GUI
development using Perl</a> page.
</p>

<p>
Browser-based games are also an option (with some help from JavaScript
and possibly AJAX) and you can see our <a href="$(ROOT)/uses/web/">Perl
web development page</a> for more information.
