<latemp_subject "Text Parsing in Perl" />

<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

<p>
Perl has a rightful reputation as a good language for parsing text and even
its name originally stands for "Practical Extraction and Report Language".
However, many beginners, are tempted to use
<a href="$(ROOT)/topics/regular-expressions/">regular expressions</a>
exclusively even for parsing the most complex texts (a la "If all you have is
a hammer, everything starts to look like a nail."), and it should be
avoided. Here we give some more options.
</p>

<h2 id="with-what-to-parse">With What to Parse Stuff?</h2>

<ul>

<li>
<p>
If you're going to parse <b>HTML</b>, don't use regular expressions,
and instead look at <a href="http://htmlparsing.icenine.ca/">Perl HTML-parsing
modules</a>. The canonical modules for that are
<cpan_self_dist d="HTML-Parser" />, which has
built-in support for handling many of the irregularities of HTML in the wild,
and <cpan_dist d="XML-LibXML">XML-LibXML's
HTML support</cpan_dist>. Those should generally not be used directly. Instead look at
one of their abstractions:
</p>

<ol>

<li>
<p>
<cpan_self_dist d="HTML-TreeBuilder-LibXML" /> - HTML::TreeBuilder and XPath compatible interface using libxml.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<cpan_self_mod m="HTML::TreeBuilder" /> (and other modules in HTML::Tree).
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<cpan_self_dist d="HTML-TokeParser-Simple" /> -
an event-based pull parser that is useful for very large HTMLs.
</p>
</li>

</ol>
</li>

<li>
<p>
In order to parse <b>XML</b>, look at <a href="$(ROOT)/uses/xml/">our dedicated
page about XML processing</a>.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<b>Comma-separated values (CSV) files</b> should be parsed using
<cpan_self_dist d="Text-CSV_XS" />, which is
a fast, tried and tested module for parsing CSV that can handle most
edge-cases and irregularities that are present in CSV files that
can be found in the wild.
</p>
</li>

</ul>

<h3 id="parser-generators">Parser Generators</h3>

<p>
For many grammars (such as those of most programming languages, which involves
such idioms as balanced brackets or operator precedence
which are called <b>context-free languages</b>), regular expressions
will not be enough and you may opt to use a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_parser_generators">parser
generator</a>. Some notable parser generators in Perl include:
</p>

<ol>

<li>
<p>
<cpan_self_dist d="Parse-RecDescent" />
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<cpan_self_dist d="Regexp-Grammars" /> -
a more modern version of Parse-RecDescent by the same author that only
works on perl-5.10.x and above.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<cpan_self_dist d="Parse-Yapp" /> - old
and has been unmaintained, but may still be good enough.
</p>
</li>

</ol>

<p>
What a parser generator does is generate a parser for your language that
can then yield an "abstract syntax tree (AST)" that will allow you to process
valid texts of this language as a human would understand them.
</p>

<h3 id="incremental-extraction">Incremental Extraction in Regular Expressions
Using \G and /g</h3>

<p>
Sometimes, you'll find that writing everything in one regular expression
would be very hard and you'd like to parse a string incrementally - step by
step. For that, Perl offers the
<a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/functions/pos.html">the pos()</a>
function/operator that allows one to set the last matched position within
a string. One can make a good use of it using the <tt>\G</tt> regular
expression escape and the <tt>/g</tt> and <tt>/c</tt> regex modifiers.
</p>

<p>
Here's an example:
</p>

<pre>
\# String with names inside square brackets
my $string = "Hello [Peter] , [Sophie] and [Jack] are here.";

pos($string) = 0;
while (my $string =~ m{\G.*\[([^\]+)\]}cg)
{
    my $name = $1;
    print "Found name $name .\n";
}
</pre>

<p>
This example is a bit contrived, but should be illustrative enough.
</p>
