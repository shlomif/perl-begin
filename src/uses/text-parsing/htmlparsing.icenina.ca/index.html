<h1 class="center">How to parse HTML/XML</h1><h2 class="center">(Or Any Arbitrarily Nested Data)</h2>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p class="bodyText">When faced with the task of parsing HTML (or
XML and some other similar grammars) many people immediately think
of using the powerful text processing capabilities of regular
expressions to do the work for them. This is usually the wrong
approach. HTML is a very 'loose' language to begin with and
additionally it has over the years become more and more abused by
lazy programmers and novices who don't follow its specifications or
grammar rules. This leaves us with tremendous amount of
non-conforming or outright broken HTML code out there that is being
used on a regular basis. Over the years, parsers have evolved to
the point of being able to cope with common problematic HTML and
will happily parse out even the most horrible pages for you at
least with some degree of accuracy to the document's original
intent.</p>
<p class="bodyText">With that said, regular expressions have not
(nor would they have any reason to have) evolved over the years to
deal with the voluminous amount of horrid HTML out there. They are
for matching specific patterns. They can be applied to things that
have a known structure or format. They are inherently not good at
distinguishing between patterns that a human (or a token parser)
could easily distinguish such as (but not limited to) HTML nested
in comments, overlapping tags, HTML entities, etc. They are also
not good at focusing on a particular part of a document based on
the relative structure. Most importantly, they are very bad at
adapting to even small changes in the document itself.</p>
<p class="bodyText">So without further ado, here is how you parse
HTML documents:</p>
<h2><em>DON'T</em> use a Regular Expression (Regex, Regexp,
RE)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Regular Expressions often break when parsing nested data.</li>
<li>Writing regular expressions to parse HTML/XML will not save you
time, it will waste your time.</li>
<li>Don't ask for people to help you write a regex to parse
HTML/XML -- if they are qualified to help you, they already know
you should be using a parser anyway.</li>
</ul>
<h2><em>DO</em> use an HTML/XML Parser (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20081101111536/http://htmlparsing.icenine.ca/#parsers">examples</a>)</h2>
<ul>
<li>HTML/XML Parsers are (coincidentally) designed to parse
HTML/XML.</li>
<li>The people that spent the time writing parsers would simply
have done it with a regular expression if that was the right way to
do it.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="center">When you can make some very strict guarantees
about your data, it <em>MIGHT</em> be okay to parse it with a
regular expression.</h3>
<h3>If...</h3>
<ul>
<li>This is a one-time script</li>
<li>AND the data has a known regular structure</li>
<li>AND the tags do not span lines</li>
<li>AND there are no multiple nested tags</li>
<li>AND the parts you need from the data are simple in nature</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="center"><strong>If you can not guarantee <em>ALL</em> of
the above, <em>DON'T DON'T DON'T</em> use a regular
expression</strong></h3>
