<latemp_subject "Graphical User Interface (GUI) Development in Perl" />

<p>
Graphical User Interfaces (or "GUIs") are rich, graphical programs and
applications that are displayed on the screen using windows, menus, buttons,
input boxes, list boxes and other controls. Perl has extensive support
for many GUI libraries.
</p>

<h2 id="wxperl"><a href="http://wxperl.sourceforge.net/">wxPerl</a></h2>

<p>
wxPerl is a Perl interface to the open source, cross-platform
<a href="http://www.wxwidgets.org/">wxWidgets library</a>, which provides
native look and feel, while still providing a lot of convenience.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://padre.perlide.org/">Padre, the Perl IDE</a> is being
written using wxPerl, and one can search its source code (using
<a href="http://betterthangrep.com/">ack</a> ,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep">grep</a> or a similar tool)
to find useful examples of wxPerl code in action.
</p>

<h2 id="perl-tk"><cpan_dist d="Tk">Perl-Tk</cpan_dist></h2>

<p>
Perl-Tk is a port of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tk_%28framework%29">the Tk toolkit</a>
that originated with Tcl, to Perl. It is cross-platform and open-source, but
provides relatively unattractive widgets/controls, which are not easily
skinnable. However, it provides a high-level API with many convenient niceties,
and is commonly available.

<h3 id="qt"><a href="http://techbase.kde.org/Development/Languages/Perl">Perl/Qt and Perl/KDE</a></h3>

<p>
Perl bindings to the <a href="http://qt.nokia.com/">portable Qt library</a>
and the various libraries of <a href="http://www.kde.org/">KDE (the K Desktop
Environment)</a>, which is written using it. The licence of the bindings
is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License">GNU
General Public License</a> which is incompatible with many publicly distributed
non-open-source and open-source licences, but using it for programs for
in-house use is OK.
</p>

<h2 id="gtk"><a href="http://gtk2-perl.sourceforge.net/">gtk2-perl</a></h2>

<p>
A set of Perl bindings for GTK+ and various related libraries (including
those of the GNOME project). Provides an attractive look and feel on
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System">X-Window</a>-based
UNIX systems (including Linux) which looks quite foreign on
Microsoft Windows. A very capable and powerful GUI library.
