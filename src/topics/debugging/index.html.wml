<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

<p>
There are several ways to debug Perl programs, to find the cause of bugs,
and to find a good solution for them. Many Perl beginners don't make use
of the Perl's debuggers, such as the <tt>-d</tt> flag or the various
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?query=Devel&amp;mode=all">Devel::
modules</a>. This is unfortunate because they are very convenient and
can save a lot of time.

<h3 id="devel-trace"><cpan_self_dist d="Devel-Trace" /></h3>

<p>
Allows one to print each line before it is executed.
</p>

<h3 id="devel-linetrace"><cpan_self_dist d="Devel-LineTrace" /></h3>

<p>
Allows one to assign code to be executed on individual lines in the program.
This allows to use it instead of adding print's to the code, which later need
to be removed.

<p>
An enhanced debugger for Perl, which while originally derived from
<tt>perl5db.pl</tt> broke internal and external compatibility with the
aim of making debugging better.
