<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

<p>
Perl Modules and Perl Packages are two closely related - but independent -
subjects that enable writing more reusable and more modular code. Furthermore,
packages are the basis of Perl's
<a href="$(ROOT)/topics/object-oriented/">Object Oriented Programming</a>.

<h3 id="modules">Modules</h3>

<p>
Modules allow you to put some reusable Perl code into its own file, which can
then be loaded from any Perl program, or from a different module. One can then
call subroutines from these modules or even import them into the current scope.
</p>

<h3 id="packages">Packages</h3>

<p>
Packages are known as namespaces in other languages, and are Perl's way of
making sure not all symbols live in the same place. One can create an arbitrary
number of packages in Perl and they can be nested. It is a good idea that
the package and module names will correspond to avoid confusion.

Chapter 10 of this of this book for Perl beginners (including absolute
beginners) covers modules. This book was written by one of the foremost
Perl experts.

<perl_for_newbies_entry>

<p>
The third talk in the series explains modules and packages in detail, although
from a very low level and how they work behind the scenes.

<h2 id="cpan"><a href="$(ROOT)/topics/cpan/">CPAN</a></h2>

<p>
CPAN stands for the <b>Comprehensive Perl Archive Network</b> and is a
repository of many re-usable, open-source, modules that can be used in one's
Perl code. See the link for more information.

An alternative to the built-in Exporter.pm module which is much more powerful
and easier to use.
