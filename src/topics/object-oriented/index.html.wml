<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

<p>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming">Object-oriented
programming</a> (or OOP for short) is a software-design paradigm that allows
for writing more re-usable and more elegant code by declaring <b>classes</b>
that define the functionality that their various instances, called
<b>objects</b> have.
</p>

<p>
There's a myth going on that Perl is not an object-oriented language. It's
not true and starting from Perl 5 (which has been the standard Perl version
since 1994), Perl has had support for a very powerful and flexible object
system. While it is true that Perl does not force one to program using
object-oriented programming (because it is often an overkill), it does allow
OOP when one needs and wants to.

<h2 id="moose">Moose</h2>

<p>
<a href="http://www.iinteractive.com/moose/"><b>Moose</b></a> is a post-modern
object system for Perl. It supports a meta-object protocol, has a built-in
type system, support roles, and is considered the modern way to do
object-oriented programming in Perl.
<a href="http://www.iinteractive.com/moose/">The Moose homepage</a> contains
a lot of information about it including introductory talks, articles, and
links.
