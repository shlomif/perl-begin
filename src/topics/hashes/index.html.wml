<latemp_subject "Perl Hashes (a.k.a Associative Arrays or Maps)" />

<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

<p>
<b>Hashes</b> (also known as "associative arrays", or in other languages
"maps" or "dictionaries") allow the programmer to map arbitrary strings to
arbitrary values. Perl has a convenient syntax to support hashes as first
order data structures.
