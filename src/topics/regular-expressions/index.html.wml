<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

<p>
Regular expressions (also known as "regexes", "regexps" and "re's") allow
the Perl programmer to easily locate simple or somewhat more complex patterns
inside a larger text, and
process the text accordingly. Many beginners are intimidated by regular
expressions, but they are well-worth to invest the time to learn and understand
because processing text character-by-character would be slower, take more
code and would not be idiomatic.

<h3 id="misusing_regexes">Misusing Regexes</h3>

<p>
Yet another issue is that some programmers tend to misuse regular expressions
(including only one at a time) in order to do tasks for which they are not
very suitable for. See <a href="$(ROOT)/uses/text-parsing/">our page
about parsing text</a> for some better alternatives.
