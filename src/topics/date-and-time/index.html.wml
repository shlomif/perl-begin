<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

<p>
Many newcomers to Perl ask how to properly handle, process and manipulate
dates and times in Perl. The proper answer is that while Perl has basic
facilities for this in <pdoc d="perlfunc"></pdoc> and the POSIX module,
one should use a good date-and-time module from CPAN. This page aims
to lead people in the right direction.

<h2 id="cpan">CPAN Distributions for Date and Time Manipulation</h2>

<h3 id="DateTime">DateTime</h3>

<p>
The <cpan_b_self_dist d="DateTime" /> CPAN
distribution is a highly recommended module for handling dates and times.
Here are some useful helper packages for it:
</p>

<ul>

<li>
<cpan_self_dist d="DateTime-Format-Strptime" />
- parses dates in arbitrary formats.
</li>

<li>
<cpan_self_dist d="DateTime-Format-W3CDTF" />,
<cpan_self_dist d="DateTime-Format-Atom" />
and other "DateTime-Format-" modules - useful for parsing
and formatting dates using various standard date formats.
</li>

<li>
<cpan_self_dist d="DateTime-Format-Natural" />
allows one to convert dates in human-time to a DateTime object.
</li>

<li>
<cpan_self_dist d="Time-Duration" /> converts a
duration (in seconds, which can be calculated from a DateTime object) into a human
readable expression of it (exact or rounded). Like "10 minutes ago", "1 hour ago", etc.
</li>

</ul>
