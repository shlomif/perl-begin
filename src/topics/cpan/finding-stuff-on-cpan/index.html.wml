<p>
The first step to finding stuff on CPAN is to try to use the
<a href="http://metacpan.org/"><b>MetaCPAN</b></a> search engine, which
has many measures for facilitating finding high quality stuff, including
upvotes, ratings, comments, links to the bug trackers and many
other resources, and many more.

<h2 id="ask_for_recommendation">Ask for Recommendations</h2>

<p>
If in doubt, you can try asking for recommendations on
<a href="http://perl-begin.org/resources/#get_help">an internet forum</a>
such as Freenodeâ€™s <code>#perl</code> chat room.
