<latemp_subject "Using CPAN with Perl" />

<p>
"CPAN" stands for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPAN">the
Comprehensive Perl Archive Network</a> and is an internationally mirrored
collection of over 16,000 packages of re-usable Perl code. To program
in Perl 5 effectively, one needs to make a judicious, but liberal use of
CPAN code, due to the fact that the perl core distribution is kept relatively
minimal and its maintainers expect people to use CPAN for any extraneous
functionality.
</p>

<p>
One good advice in using CPAN is to <b>look for native packages for your
operating system, distribution and Perl distribution</b>. Many such
distributions allow one to automatically install pre-built CPAN packages
that can later on be easily and cleanly uninstalled. Look for such packages
for distributions you need in the relevant repositories of the distribution
of perl 5 that you are using.
</p>

<p>
If you cannot find packages for what you want, you can also try building
a native package automatically from the equivalent CPAN package.
The <a href="http://perl.net.au/">PerlNet wiki</a> has the details about
<a href="http://perl.net.au/wiki/CPAN#CPAN.pm.2FCPANPLUS.pm_Wrappers_for_Distributions">wrappers
of CPAN modules for the various distributions</a>.
