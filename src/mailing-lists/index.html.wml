<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>
An <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_mailing_list">electronic
mailing list</a> is a way to send E-mail messages to several people using
a single, convenient, E-mail address. One can subscribe to a mailing list to
receive messages that the other people have sent. More information can be
found in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_mailing_list">the
wikipedia page</a>.
</p>

<p>
Otherwise, you may consider joining one of the mailing lists listed here,
which have a more international focus.

, or conferences, about Perl and other computing topics where you can learn
even more about Perl.
