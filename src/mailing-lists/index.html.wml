<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>
An <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_mailing_list">electronic
mailing list</a> is a way to send E-mail messages to several people using
a single, convenient E-mail address. One can subscribe to a mailing list to
receive messages that the other people have sent. More information can be
found in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_mailing_list">the
wikipedia page</a>.
</p>

<p>
Generally, your local Perl Mongers mailing list is considered a good place
to ask <b>any</b> perl questions including beginners one. Refer to the <a
href="http://www.pm.org/">Perl Mongers International homepage</a> for <a
href="http://www.pm.org/groups/">a list of them</a>. If you can't find one in
your area, then any PM list you join will be OK, as its members will accept you
there. Perl Mongers are united world-wide in their love for Perl and their
burning desire to get more people to know it and use it as well.
</p>

<p>
Otherwise, you may consider joining one of the mailing lists listed here,
which have a more international focus.
