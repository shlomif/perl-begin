<p>
An <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_mailing_list">electronic
mailing list</a> is a way to send E-mail messages to several people using
a single, convenient, E-mail address. One can subscribe to a mailing list to
receive messages that the other people have sent. More information can be
found in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_mailing_list">the
wikipedia page</a>.
</p>

<p>
Otherwise, you may consider joining one of the mailing lists listed here,
which have a more international focus.

<p>
You can try to subscribe to a local Perl Mongers mailing list as
a good venue to ask
<b>any</b> perl questions including beginners one. Refer to the <a
href="http://www.pm.org/">Perl Mongers International homepage</a> for <a
href="http://www.pm.org/groups/">a list of them</a>. If you can't find one in
your area, you can subscribe to one nearby or possibly to a particularly active
one.

Perl Mongers groups also often host or organise meetups, workshops
, or conferences, about Perl and other computing topics where you can learn
even more about Perl.
