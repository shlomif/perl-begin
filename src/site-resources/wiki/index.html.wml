<latemp_subject "Our Wiki" />

<p>
A Wiki is a site that can be freely edited by anybody using a web-browser.
The contents of our wiki were integrated into the
<a href="http://perl.net.au/">perl.net.au MediaWiki</a> as
<a href="http://perl.net.au/wiki/New_to_Perl">its "New to Perl?" section</a>.
This was done to consolidate the Perl wiki'ing efforts, because there's much
more action on perl.net.au than there was on our wiki, and for ease of
maintenace. The original wiki on this domain has been disabled.
