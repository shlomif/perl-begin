<h2>About</h2>

<p>
Welcome to the unofficial Perl Beginners' Site. This site will provide
links and references to on-line and off-line material that can be used
to learn Perl. This site is directed both for people who learn Perl 
after knowing one or more languages, or for people who are learning
Perl as their first language.
