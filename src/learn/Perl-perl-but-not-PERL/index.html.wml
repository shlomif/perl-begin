<latemp_subject "&quot;Perl&quot; and &quot;perl&quot; but not &quot;PERL&quot;" />

<p>
One can often see the Perl programming language referred to as "perl",
"Perl" or even "PERL". This page aims to explain what is the difference between
all of them to the uninitiated.
</p>

<ol>

<li>
<p>
<b>"Perl"</b> is the name of the programming language itself. It had several
versions starting from version 1 up to version 5 which is the current popular
version as well as <a href="../perl6/">Perl 6</a> which is currently under
development and won't be compatible with Perl 5 and below. So if you want to
refer to the language say "Perl" with a capital "P" and the other letters
as lowercase.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<b>"perl"</b> (with all-lowercase) is the name of the command line executable
that compiles and runs Perl programs. The implementation if you may.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
In any case, one should <b>never write "PERL"</b> with all uppercase-letters,
as Perl is not an acronym. If you encounter such a page, it usually indicates
that its author does not know enough about Perl, as writing "Perl" or "perl"
instead of "PERL" is a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shibboleth">Shibboleth</a> that indicates
that the speaker or writer knows what they are saying.
</p>
</li>

</ol>

<p>
A popular idiom, attributed to Tom Christiansen, says that "Only perl can
parse Perl.". Take some time to think about it.
