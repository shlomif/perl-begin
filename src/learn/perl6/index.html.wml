<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

<p>
A lot of people have been wondering about the relationship between the
commonly used Perl language, currently versioned at a version of 5 (also known
as "Perl 5") and its so called "perl 5" implementation and the
under development language known as "Perl 6". In order to avoid confusion,
this page would like to clarify the situation.
</p>

<h2 id="different">Perl 6 is different from Perl 5</h2>

<p>
Perl 6 is a completely different language from Perl 5, and also incompatible.
To some extent, the Perl 6 community of developers is different than that of
Perl 5. Perl 6 is not meant to displace Perl 5.
</p>

<h2 id="perl5_not_going_away">Perl 5 (the language) and
perl 5 (the implementation) are not going away</h2>

<p>
The perl 5 implementation is still under constant development, and is
constantly improved. There is a steady and growing flow of
<a href="$(ROOT)/topics/cpan/">CPAN</a> modules written in Perl 5, and there's
an active community of Perl 5 users, contributors and developers. The original
plan for Perl 6 was not to completely displace Perl 5, but rather to provide
a radical rewrite (of both the implementation and the language) with many
improvements (and incompatible with Perl 5). It is assumed that Perl 5 will
be used, improved and supported for many years to come.
</p>

<h2 id="positive_influence">Perl 6 has positively influenced Perl 5</h2>

<p>
Perl 6 features have proved to be a useful inspiration for recent Perl 5
developments, such as core features in perl-5.10.x, perl-5.12.x and future
versions, and CPAN distributions such as
<a href="http://www.iinteractive.com/moose/">Moose</a>,
<cpan_self_dist d="autobox" />
and
<cpan_self_dist d="Method-Signatures" />.
Tim Bunce has written in his
<a href="http://blog.timbunce.org/2008/03/08/perl-myths/">"Perl
Myths" presentation</a> that while some people think that "Perl 6 is killing
Perl 5", it has in fact saved it and advanced it.
</p>

<h2 id="is_perl_6_still_perl">Is Perl 6 Still Perl?</h2>

<p>
That depends on who you ask. Some people feel that Perl 6 is so radically
different from Perl 5 (which is in turn compatible with all the previous
versions of the language), that it is no longer "Perl", enough to say that
"Perl 6 will be a wonderful language. Too bad it won't be Perl.". Other
people claim that there are enough similarities, and that since it was also
designed by Larry Wall, who is the father of Perl, it can be considered
Perl. In our opinion, it doesn't make a difference whether Perl 6 is Perl or
not, because it is already called Perl 6 and either people will like it as
such or not, regardless of the name.
