<latemp_subject "Perl Books that cover Specific Topics" />

<p>
Perl has many third-party APIs available on CPAN, many of which interface it
with existing APIs written in other languages. If you have a task that needs
performing, chances are that Perl is exactly the right tool for the job.
</p>

<p>
Many specialized books were written to cover the specific technologies and
their application to Perl. Alternatively, these books cover specific topics
and in it cover several CPAN modules that can do the job.
</p>

<p>
Since there are so many books like that out there, we will simply provide
links to the book pages on <a href="http://books.perl.org/">the Perl books
registry</a>, where you can find more information, and reviews
