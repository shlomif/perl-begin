It is not absolutely necessary to read an organized book, in order to learn
Perl. However, occasionally many people like it better than reading an ad hoc
tutorial on their computer screens, and then trying to understand the man
pages. Here is a list of books that can teach you Perl with some remarks on
each book.

<p>
A book by chromatic, a well-known Perl programmer, writer, and author, about
how to write Perl 5 in a good and modern way. Covers from the basics up to
doing object-oriented programming using Moose, and a bit beyond. I've read this
book and can recommend it.
</p>

<p>
The book is <a href="[% modern_perl_book_url %]">available online for free
download</a> and viewing and we have
<a href="[% base_path %]tutorials/modern-perl/">a local mirror</a>.

<p>
This book is intended for people who are new to programming and wish to
learn how to program using Perl. Those that already have a past experience in
programming, will find it easier, but otherwise, even those without
prior experience will be able to learn using it.
</p>

<p>
The first edition of the book is available online for free download but
is outdated and no longer recommended. There is a <a href="[% beginning_perl_url %]">preview version</a> of the latest edition available in archive.org.

<p>
Also referred to as "the Llama Book". Considered
one of the best books for people who are absolute beginners in Perl and even
in programming in general. This book however, does not cover references,
modules, and objects and other important features of the Perl language. As
such, you'll usually need to complement your learning by using another
resource.
</p>

<p>
It is also <b>not intended for people who are absolute beginners</b> in
programming.

A book that teaches Perl for people who have no programming experience. Takes
an unusual approach of introducing them to Literate Programming as well,
and using it for creating documentation and better organizing the examples.

<p>
This book teaches Perl for experienced C Programmers. It is comprehensive
and encompassing and tries to focus on Perl code that resembles C as much as
possible. If you don't know C either, it will probably be of little help.
