Perl code can be written to run perfectly on both Windows and UNIXes, out

will be such, and this is the case for most CPAN Perl modules as well.

ActiveState has <a

list for Win32 users</a>. Generally, Perl for Win32 questions can be
effectively answered in beginners mailing lists as well, but this mailing
list may also prove of help especially in regards to Win32-specific Perl
extensions.
