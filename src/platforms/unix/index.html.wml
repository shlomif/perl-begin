<p>
If you are using a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix">UNIX-compatible
system</a> (such as <a href="http://www.linux.org/">Linux</a>,
<a href="http://www.sun.com/software/solaris/index.jsp">Solaris</a>,
or a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Software_Distribution">BSD</a>), most
chances are that Perl 5 is already installed there. To verify that, type
<tt>perl -v</tt> inside a command shell, and check that the version of Perl is
recent enough. If so, you can easily run Perl scripts there.
</p>

<p>
Even if this is not the case, you can usually install it from the
distribution you are using, assuming you are an administrator of the system.
Else, given enough quota it is possible to install the most recent version of
Perl 5 under your home directory.  This procedure can be followed by
downloading the latest Perl source from
<a href="http://www.cpan.org/">CPAN</a>, and following the instructions in
the <tt>INSTALL</tt> file.

<h3 id="perldoc">Setting up a local Perldoc</h3>

<p>
The <pdoc d="perldoc"></pdoc>
documentation program is not always present in the default installation, as many
non-programmers or non-Perl programmers are not going to use it. It can
be installed by:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
Installing the "perl-doc" or "perldoc" package using your distribution's
package manager. See its documentation or support for details
</li>
<li>
Installing <a href="http://docperl.sourceforge.net/">DocPerl</a>
which is a web-interface to the local Perl documentation.
</li>
<li>
Installing <cpan_self_mod m="tkpod" /> which is a Perl/Tk-based interface.
</li>
<li>
Alternatively one can access the <a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/">online
perl documentation</a>, which may deviate from what you have.
</li>
</ol>
