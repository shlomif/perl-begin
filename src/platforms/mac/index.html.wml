<latemp_subject "Perl on Mac OS" />

<p>
    Mac OS X, being mostly compatible with UNIX can, easily run Perl 5, as 
    compiled and installed from the source. Mac OS Classic requires MacPerl,
    which I never worked with. Mac OS X is still highly recommended from the
    aspect of running Perl or otherwise.
