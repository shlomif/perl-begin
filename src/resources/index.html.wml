<latemp_subject "Resources for Learning Perl" />

<p>
One should note that in order to get help with Perl code, you <b>should first
make a minimal effort to learn it</b>. Perl is a relatively easy language to
learn, and most programmers can easily get the hang of it, and become
productive with it. If you don't want to learn it, then there are many Perl
<b>consultants who will be happy to help you for a fee</b>. But the Perl gods
only help those who help themselves.

<dt id="tutorials">
<a href="$(ROOT)/tutorials/">Tutorials</a>
</dt>
<dd>
A list of recommended online tutorials for learning Perl and getting up to
speed with it. Normally they don't teach everything you can possibly know,
but they should be OK to start with if you're impatient. As such they are
optimized for starting to write code, not reading that of much more experienced
Perl programmers, or those that use a different style from you.

<dl>

<dt id="irc"><a href="$(ROOT)/irc/">IRC (Internet Relay Chat)</a></dt>

<dd>
Internet Relay Chat is probably the fastest way to receive answers to most
common beginner questions. Please visit <a href="$(ROOT)/irc/">the link</a> to
learn more about it, and see where it is best to ask, what to avoid doing and
what to expect.
</dd>

<dt id="mailing-lists"><a href="$(ROOT)/mailing-lists/">Mailing Lists</a></dt>

<dd>
Mailing lists allow you to ask questions by E-mail and also learn from
similar discussions. They are the best solution for more obscure questions,
or if you're not short on time and want less interactive, but more in-depth
discussions.
</dd>

<dt id="web-forums"><a href="$(ROOT)/web-forums/">Web Forums</a></dt>

<dd>
Web forums are similar to mailing lists, but all interaction is done through
a web-browser, and one can use
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_feed">web feeds</a> to monitor them.
We have concentrated a selection of Perl-related web forums on
<a href="$(ROOT)/web-forums/">the Web Forums page</a>.
