<p>
One should note that in order to get help with Perl code, you should first
make a <b>minimal effort</b> to learn it. Perl is a relatively easy language to
learn, and most programmers can easily get the hang of it, and become
productive with it. If you don't want to learn it, then there are many Perl
<b>consultants</b> who will be happy to help you for a fee. But the Perl gods
only help those who help themselves.

<a href="[% base_path %]tutorials/">Tutorials</a>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
A list of recommended online tutorials for learning Perl and getting up to
speed with it. Normally they don't teach everything you can possibly know,
but they should be OK to start with, if you're impatient. As such they are
optimized for starting to write code, not reading that of much more experienced
Perl programmers, or those that use a different style from you.
