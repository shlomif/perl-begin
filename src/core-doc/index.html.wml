<h2 id="online-docs">Online Documentation</h2>

<ul>

<li>
<a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/">Perldoc</a> - contains a searchable index
for the core perl documentation.
</li>

<li>
<a href="http://perl.enstimac.fr/">French version of the Perl
Manual</a> - a bit out-of-date, but still very pertinent for beginners.
</li>

</ul>

<h2 id="books">Books</h2>

<h3 id="camel-book"><a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/pperl3/">Programming Perl, 3rd
Edition</a></h3>

<p>
The Bible of Perl. Makes an easier and more organized read than the online
core documentation, and provides explanation for every last nuance of the
Perl language. Also contains a lot of jokes and Perl musings, and an
introduction to the culture behind Perl.
</p>

<p>
Not recommended as an introductory Perl book, but still makes a very good read
after the language is learned to a working extent.
</p>

<h3 id="cookbook"><a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/cookbook/">The Perl Cookbook</a></h3>

<p>
A book that contains a long list of code snippets for achieving certain tasks
in Perl, with some discussion on how they work and how to customize them.
