<h2 id="note">Note</h2>

<p>
These online tutorials can provide an introduction to Perl so you can start
writing your own scripts. Nevertheless, they don't teach everything there is
to know about the language and one should still take care to learn all other
things on his own from other resources.

<perl_for_newbies_entry>

<p>
Intended for People with basic knowledge of C or something similar or even no
knowledge of any programming language at all. Contains verbose slides filled
with explanation, examples and anecdotes. Covers a basic subset of Perl,
without too many "other ways to do it". (you are still expected to read the
POD documents after the second lecture)
