<h1 id="heading_id_2">Perl and Its Community</h1>
<p>Perl 5's greatest accomplishment is the huge amount of reusable libraries developed for it. Where Perl 4 had forks to connect to databases such as Oracle and Sybase, for example, Perl 5 had a real extension mechanism. Larry wanted people to create and maintain their own extensions without fragmenting Perl into thousands of incompatible pidgins--and it worked.</p>
<p>That technical accomplishment was almost as important as the growth of a community around Perl 5. <em>People</em> write libraries. <em>People</em> build on the work of other people. <em>People</em> make a community worth joining and preserving and expanding.</p>
<p>The Perl community is strong and healthy. It welcomes willing participants at all levels, from novices to core developers. Take advantage of the knowledge and experience of countless other Perl programmers, and you'll become a better programmer.</p>
<h2 id="heading_id_3">The CPAN</h2>
<div id="cpan"></div>
<p>Perl 5 is a pragmatic language on its own, yet the ever-pragmatic Perl community has extended that language and made their work available to the world. If you have a problem to solve, chances are someone's already written--and shared--Perl code for it.</p>
<div id="iCPAN_1"></div>
<p>Modern Perl programming makes heavy use of the CPAN (<span class="url">http://www.cpan.org/</span>). The Comprehensive Perl Archive Network is an uploading and mirroring system for redistributable, reusable Perl code. It's one of--if not <em>the</em>--largest archives of libraries of code in the world. The CPAN offers libraries for everything from database access to profiling tools to protocols for almost every network device ever created to sound and graphics libraries and wrappers for shared libraries on your system.</p>
<p>Modern Perl without the CPAN is just another language. Modern Perl with the CPAN is amazing.</p>
<div id="idistribution_0"></div>
<div id="imodules_0"></div>
<p>CPAN mirrors <em>distributions</em>, or collections of reusable Perl code. A single distribution can contain one or more <em>modules</em>, or self-contained libraries of Perl code. Each distribution occupies its own CPAN namespace and provides unique metadata.</p>
<div class="tip">
<p>The CPAN <em>adds</em> hundreds of registered contributors and thousands of indexed modules in hundreds of distributions every month. Those numbers do not take into account updates. In late November 2011, search.cpan.org reported 9359 uploaders, 101656 modules, and 23808 distributions (representing growth rates of 11.5%, 19.4%, and 14.3% since the previous edition of this book, respectively).</p>
</div>
<div id="isearch46cpan46org_0"></div>
<p>The CPAN itself is merely a mirroring service. Authors upload distributions and the CPAN sends them to mirror sites, from which users and CPAN clients download, configure, build, test, and install them. The system succeeds because of this simplicity as well as the contributions of thousands of volunteers who've built on this distribution system. In particular, community standards have evolved to identify the attributes and characteristics of well-formed CPAN distributions. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Standards for automated CPAN installers.</li>
<li>Standards for metadata to describe what each distribution provides and expects.</li>
<li>Standards for documentation and licensing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additional CPAN services provide comprehensive automated testing and reporting to improve the quality of packaging and correctness across platforms and Perl versions. Every CPAN distribution has its own ticket queue on <span class="url">http://rt.cpan.org/</span> for reporting bugs and working with authors. CPAN sites also link to previous distribution versions, module ratings, documentation annotations, and more. All of this is available from <span class="url">http://search.cpan.org/</span>.</p>
<div id="iCPAN__iCPAN46pm_0"></div>
<div id="iCPAN__iCPANPLUS_0"></div>
<p>Modern Perl installations include two clients to connect to, search, download, build, test, and install CPAN distributions, CPAN.pm and CPANPLUS. For the most part, each of these clients is equivalent for basic installation. This book recommends the use of CPAN.pm solely due to its ubiquity. With a recent version (as of this writing, 1.9800 is the latest stable release), module installation is reasonably easy. Start the client with:</p>
<div class="screen">
<pre>
<code>    $ <strong>cpan</strong></code>
</pre></div>
<p>To install a distribution within the client:</p>
<div class="screen">
<pre>
<code>    $ <strong>cpan</strong>
    cpan[1]&gt; <strong>install Modern::Perl</strong></code>
</pre></div>
<p>... or to install directly from the command line:</p>
<div class="screen">
<pre>
<code>    $ <strong>cpan Modern::Perl</strong></code>
</pre></div>
<div id="iCPAN__iCPAN46pm_1"></div>
<p>Eric Wilhelm's tutorial on configuring CPAN.pm <span class="footnote">(footnote: <span class="url">http://learnperl.scratchcomputing.com/tutorials/configuration/</span>)</span> includes a great troubleshooting section.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p>Even though the CPAN client is a core module for the Perl 5 distribution, you will likely need to install standard development tools such as a <code>make</code> utility and possibly a C compiler. Windows users, see Strawberry Perl (<span class="url">http://strawberryperl.com/</span>) and Strawberry Perl Professional. Mac OS X users must install XCode. Unix and Unix-like users often have these tools available (though Debian and Ubuntu users should install <code>build-essential</code>).</p>
</div>
<h3 id="heading_id_4">CPAN Management Tools</h3>
<p>If your operating system provides its own installation of Perl 5, that version may be out of date or it may have its own dependencies on specific versions of CPAN distributions. Serious Perl developers often construct virtual walls between the system Perl and their development Perl installations. Several projects help to make this possible.</p>
<p><code>App::cpanminus</code> is a relatively new CPAN client with goals of speed, simplicity, and zero configuration. Install it with <code>cpan App::cpanminus</code>, or:</p>
<div class="screen">
<pre>
<code>    $ <strong>curl -LO http://xrl.us/cpanm</strong>
    $ <strong>chmod +x cpanm</strong></code>
</pre></div>
<p><code>App::perlbrew</code> is a system to manage and to switch between your own installations of multiple versions and configurations of Perl. Installation is as easy as:</p>
<div class="screen">
<pre>
<code>    $ <strong>curl -LO http://xrl.us/perlbrew</strong>
    $ <strong>chmod +x perlbrew</strong>
    $ <strong>./perlbrew install</strong>
    $ <strong>perldoc App::perlbrew</strong></code>
</pre></div>
<div id="iCPAN__ilocal5858lib_0"></div>
<div id="iCPAN__iApp5858local5858lib5858helper_0"></div>
<p>The <code>local::lib</code> CPAN distribution allows you to install and to manage distributions in your own user directory, rather than for the system as a whole. This is an effective way to maintain CPAN distributions without affecting other users. Installation is somewhat more involved than the previous two distributions, though <code>App::local::lib::helper</code> can simplify the process. See <span class="url">http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?local::lib</span> and <span class="url">http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?App::local::lib::helper</span> for more details.</p>
<p>All three projects tend to assume a Unix-like environment (such as a GNU/Linux distribution or even Mac OS X). Windows users, see the Padre all-in-one download (<span class="url">http://padre.perlide.org/download.html</span>).</p>
