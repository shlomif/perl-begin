<p>Your own subroutines can return different values based on the value
of <tt>wantarray</tt>:</p>

<ul>
    <li> undef -- no context
    <li> false -- scalar context
    <li> true -- list/array context
</ul>

<p>You probably don't want to write a function like this.  But knowing
about wantarray probably helps you understand how Perl does such
things, and makes some issues (e.g., localtime problems) easier to
debug.</p>
