<ul>
    <li> <tt>wantarray</tt> is very cool.  But magic functions that
    return different things in different contexts can be confusing.

    <li> If a function (like <tt>print</tt>) expects a list, then be
    careful if you hand it the output from <tt>localtime</tt>.

    <li> Perl's prototypes force context.  They <i>don't</i> enforce
    data types.  This is one reason why prototypes are so rarely used,
    and why people find them so confusing.
