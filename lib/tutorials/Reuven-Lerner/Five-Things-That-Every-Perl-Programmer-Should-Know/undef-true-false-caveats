<ul>
    <li> There's a reason why <code>use warnings</code> yells if you use
    an uninitialized variable.  Sure, Perl will do what you want --
    but give variables values before you use them, unless you
    specifically want them to be undefined.

    <li> Return <code>undef</code> from subroutines if you're not
    returning a value.  I see this as a primitive exception-handling
    system.

    <li> Don't forget that 0 is different from "0".  Understanding
    what's false can sometimes be a bit tricky.
