<p>If you're an intermediate or advanced Perl programmer, then nothing
I said today should surprise you.  But these topics, again and again,
are the source of untold problems for the Perl programmers I teach.
Some suggestions:</p>

<ul>
    <li> Set up coding standards in your organization, such that
    everyone always has <tt>use strict</tt> and <tt>use warnings</tt>
    (and perhaps even <tt>use diagnostics</tt>) turned on)

    <li> TMTOWTDI doesn't mean that every method is equally good and
    useful.  Take advantage of Perl's flexibility, but consider your
    options.

    <li> Just because it's possible doesn't mean it's desireable
    (e.g., wantarray)

    <li> Lexicals vs. globals is one of the trickiest issues that you
    can imagine.  People just don't get it.  If you don't understand
    why lexicals aren't in packages, then read up on them!

    <li> Every language has its quirks and hurdles.  Perl seems to
    have a lot of them, <i>but</i> each is relatively easy to figure
    out.
</ul>
