<p>Perl has two kinds of variables that look like: lexicals and
globals.</p>

<ul>
    <li> Lexicals are declared with <tt>my</tt>.  Globals don't have
    to be declared.

    <li> Lexicals exist until the end of the block in which they were
    declared.  Globals always exist, from the time that they are first
    used unti the end of program execution.

    <li> Lexicals are not in any package.  Every global, by contrast,
    is in a package.
