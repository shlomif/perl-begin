<p>What does the below code print:</p>

<pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl

my $variable;

print $variable + 0, "\n";
</pre>

<p>Of course, it prints 0 and a newline.  Does this mean that
<tt>$variable</tt> is 0?  <b>No way.</b></p>

<ul>
    <li> Undefined variables are just that, undefined
    <li> Perl is nice enough to provide a value rather than exit with
    a runtime error
    <li> Perl provides either 0 or "" (empty string), depending on
    context
    <li> This doesn't change the value of the variable
</ul>
