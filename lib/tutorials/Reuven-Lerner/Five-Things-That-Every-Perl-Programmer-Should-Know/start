<p>You can program in Perl without knowing much... But your Perl will

<p> Today we're going to address five topics that arise again and

<ul>
        <li> Compilation vs. runtime
        <li> True vs. false vs. undef
        <li> Lexicals vs. globals
        <li> Scalars vs. lists
        <li> References
</ul>
