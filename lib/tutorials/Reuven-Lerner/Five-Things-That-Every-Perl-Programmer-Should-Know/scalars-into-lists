<p>How do we treat a bunch of scalars as a list?  Put them in
parentheses!</p>

<pre>
@array = qw(a b c);
($first, $second, $third) = @array;
</pre>

<p>This is one of my favorite features in Perl.  I often forget that
many other languages lack it.</p>

<p>To force list (array) context when looking left reveals a scalar,
just use parentheses:</p>:

<pre>
$x = @array;     # $x gets the length
($y) = @array;   # $y gets the first element
</pre>
