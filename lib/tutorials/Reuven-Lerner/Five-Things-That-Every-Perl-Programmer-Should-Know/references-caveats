<ul>
    <li> References are amazingly useful, but (for some reason) also
    very confusing.  If you're going to use references, be sure to
    check that you know what you're doing.  If you're new to Perl,
    it's worth consider

    <li> Objects in Perl are references -- usually hash refs, but
    sometimes scalar or array refs.  Learn to be fluent with them

    <li> Remember the difference between references to existing
    variables and anonymous array/hash references

    <li> Copying can bring about some surprises (deep vs. shallow
    copying)
</ul>
