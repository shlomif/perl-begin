<ul>
    <li> Perl <b>is</b> a compiled language!
    <li> Compiled into opcodes, sorta like JVM bytecodes
    <li> Opcodes are then executed by the Perl runtime engine
    <li> Knowing the difference can save you lots of headaches
</ul>

<p>For example, people often think that they can do this:</p>

<pre>
if ($] >= 5.006)
{
    use warnings;
}
</pre>
