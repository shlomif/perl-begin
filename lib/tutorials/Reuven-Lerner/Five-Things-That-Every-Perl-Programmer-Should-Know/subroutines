<ul>
    <li> Subroutines are defined at compile time
    <li> (If this weren't true, you couldn't define subroutines as the
    end of a file, could you?)
    <li> Name lookup is  done at runtime
</ul>

<pre>
print times_10(100), "\n";

sub times_ten {
    my $arg = shift;
    return $arg * 10;
}
</pre>

<p>The above exits with a run-time error, not a compliation error.  Is
the compiler dumb?  No -- it just wants to let you use AUTOLOAD, or
define subroutines in an eval, or load modules dynamically, or other
fun things.</p>
