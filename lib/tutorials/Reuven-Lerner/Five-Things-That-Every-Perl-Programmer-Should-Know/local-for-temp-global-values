<p>Hey, why use the fancy word "lexical"?  Why not just say
"local"?<p>

<ul>
    <li> Because the  <tt>local</tt> function only works with globals

    <li> (And you should almost never use it.)

    <li> <tt>local</tt> gives a global a temp value through the end of
    the block
</ul>

<pre>
$x = 100;
print "Before, x is '$x'\n";

{
    local $x = 'tree';
    print "During, x is '$x'\n";
}

print "After, x is '$x'\n";
</pre>

<p>Looks like a lexical, right?  Perhaps -- but something very
different is happening behind the scenes.  You can use <tt>local</tt>
with <tt>$/</tt>, but you certainly can't use <tt>my</tt> with it!</p>
