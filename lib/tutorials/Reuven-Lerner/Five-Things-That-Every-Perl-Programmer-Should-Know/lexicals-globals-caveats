<ul>
    <li> <tt>use strict</tt> is your friend.
    <li> Don't use globals outside of a package.
    <li> Don't try to use packages with lexicals...
    <li> ... unless you want to do cool things like singletons
    <li> Don't call "lexical" variables "local" variables
    <li> Use lexicals everywhere you can...
    <li> ... and especially in subroutines
    <li> Don't use <tt>local</tt> until and unless you read MJD's
    article (and understand it)
    <li> Namespace pollution? Exporting?  It works great, but can be
    confusing at first.  Learn <tt>@EXPORT</tt>, <tt>@EXPORT_OK</tt>,
    and <tt>%EXPORT_TAGS</tt> well before you use them
</ul>
