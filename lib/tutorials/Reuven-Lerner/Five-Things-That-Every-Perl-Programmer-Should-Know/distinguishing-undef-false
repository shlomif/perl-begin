<ul>
    <li> Undef is just that, undef -- but when forced to provide a
    value, Perl will give you 0 or "", which is false.
    <li> The number 0 is false.  The empty string  ("") is false.  All
    other scalar values are true.
</ul>

<p>Beginning Perl programmers think that all variables default to 0 or
the empty string.  But they don't.  We can tell the difference between
false and undef with <code>defined</code>:</p>

<pre>
my $var;
print "(1) var is defined, with a value of '$var'\n" if (defined $var);
print "(1) var is true\n" if ($var);

$var = 0;
print "(2) var is defined, with a value of '$var'\n" if (defined $var);
print "(2) var is true\n" if ($var);

$var = 1;
print "(3) var is defined, with a value of '$var'\n" if (defined $var);
print "(3) var is true\n" if ($var);
</pre>
