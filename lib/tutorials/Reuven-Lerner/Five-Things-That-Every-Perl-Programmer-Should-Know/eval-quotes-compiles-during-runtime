<ul>
    <li> So now we know how to run something at compile time.

    <li> Can we do the opposite, compiling at runtime?  Of course!
    <tt>eval</tt> is your friend.

    <li> Remember that we're using the quoted version of eval here,
    not the block version of eval.

    <li> <tt>eval "$x + $y"</tt> compiles the code in the string and
    then executes it, just like Perl does to your main program.

    <li> Stuff in quotes is checked for validity during its compile
    time, not at your program's compile time.  Any errors are put in
    <tt>$@</tt>, trapped by <tt>eval</tt>.

    <li> <tt>eval</tt> is amazingly useful ... but is also overused.
    It's inefficient, and potentially dangerous.
