<p>We can solve our <tt>if</tt>-<tt>use</tt> problem by defining a
subroutine that's not only defined at compile time, but also executes
at compile time: <tt>BEGIN</tt>.</p>

<pre>
BEGIN {
    if ($] >= 5.006)
    {
	use warnings;
    }
}
</pre>

<p>Note that we don't have to say <tt>sub BEGIN</tt>.

<p>You can put anything you want in a <tt>BEGIN</tt>.  Heck, you could
put your whole program in a <tt>BEGIN</tt>!  But don't do that.
Please.</p>
