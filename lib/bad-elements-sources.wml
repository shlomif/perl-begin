also contains material for further reading:

<ol>
<li>
<p>
<a href="$(ROOT)/books/advanced/#pbp">The
Book "Perl Best Practices"</a> by Damian Conway - contains a lot of good
advice and food for thought, but sometimes should be deviated from.
Also see the

Module Recommendation Commentary"</a> on the Perl 5 Wiki.

<li>
<p>
The book
<a href="http://pragprog.com/book/tpp/the-pragmatic-programmer"><i>The Pragmatic
Programmer: From Journeyman to Master</i></a> - also not particularly about
Perl, and I found it somewhat disappointing, but it is an informative book.

Advice given by people on <a href="$(ROOT)/irc/#freenode">Freenode's #perl
