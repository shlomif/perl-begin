<h2 id="gui-debugger">Graphical Debugger Front-ends</h2>

<p>
While not full-fledged IDEs, these tools are useful as graphical debugger
front-ends.
</p>

<ul>

<li>
<p>
<cpan_self_dist d="Devel-ptkdb" /> - a Perl/Tk based graphical debugger. Was
not maintained since 2004, but may still get the job done.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/ddd/">GNU DDD (The Data Display
Debugger)</a> - a Motif-based graphical front-end to several debuggers
including the perl debugger.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<a href="http://curtmckelvey.tripod.com/perldbgui/">perldbgui</a> - another
Perl/Tk GUI for the Perl debugger. Stuck at DR-1.
</p>
</li>

</ul>
