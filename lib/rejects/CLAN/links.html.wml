<h2>Documents</h2>

<p>
<a href="http://www.cpan.org/misc/ZCAN.html">The Zen of Comprehensive Archive
Networks</a> - a document by Jarkko Hietaniemi, the CPAN master librarian
on how to construct such comprehensive archive networks like we intend do.
Brings some lessons from CPAN, and indicates why it has been successful.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000043.html">The Joel
Test : 12 Steps to Better Code</a> - an insightful article (orignallly
derived from the McConnell Test) giving some guidelines for useful management
of a "shrinkwrap" project. CLAN aims for just that.
</p>

<h2>Reference Projects</h2>

<p>
<a href="http://oprofile.sourceforge.net./">OProfile</a> - a system-wide
profiler for GNU/Linux that contains an externally maintained kernel module.
Provided reference for writing the appropriate makefile for the LKMB packages.
</p>

<h2>Similar Efforts for Other Systems</h2>

<p>
<a href="http://www.cpan.org/">CPAN - The Comperhensive Perl
Archive Network</a> - a repository of useful modules for the Perl programming
language, that can be installed at ease while resolving all depenedencies. CLAN
,in fact, will be available as a set of CPAN packages.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.debian.org/distrib/packages">The Debian Package Pool</a> -
a comprehensive repository of packages for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution
that are maintained by volunteers. Easily installable and upgradable using
a utility named "apt".
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.linux-mandrake.com/cooker/urpmi.html">urpmi</a> - an
interface around RPM created by MandrakeSoft to resolve the unique problems
faced in handling the RPM package format. Extensively used in a Mandrake Linux
environment and very convenient as well for maintaing the packages.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</a> - its packages management is
source based and very configurable (you can specify configuration options for
packages at compile time). Also look for
<a href="http://www.gentoo.org/">Gentoo Linux</a> which implemented a similar
functionatily for a GNU/Linux system.
